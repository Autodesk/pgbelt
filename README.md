PgBelt is a CLI tool used to manage Postgres data migrations from beginning to end,
for a single database or a fleet, leveraging pglogical replication.

It was built to assist in migrating data between postgres databases with as
little application downtime as possible. It works in databases running different versions
of postgres and makes it easy to run many migrations in parallel during a single downtime.

| As with all Data Migration tasks, **there is a risk of data loss**. Please ensure you have backed up your data before attempting any migrations |
